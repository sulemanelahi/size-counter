# 📏 Size Counter

A simple CLI tool using npm and JavaScript to count the byte size. The tool supports flags for kilobytes (KBs), gigabytes (GBs), and terabytes (TBs). The project is designed to provide an efficient way to measure the byte size of files and directories.

The project was inspired by the challenge I set for myself to create a Word Counter (wc) tool command-line interface (CLI), drawing inspiration from [coding challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc).
