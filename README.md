# 📏 Size Counter

A simple CLI tool using npm and JavaScript to count the byte size. The tool supports flags for kilobytes (KBs), gigabytes (GBs), and terabytes (TBs). The project is designed to provide an efficient way to measure the byte size of files and directories.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

1. Install the package globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g size-counter
```

2. Run the `size` command with the desired options and the path to the file or directory:

### Options

- `-b, --bytes`: Display size in bytes.
- `-k, --kilobytes`: Display size in kilobytes.
- `-g, --gigabytes`: Display size in gigabytes.
- `-t, --terabytes`: Display size in terabytes.

### Example
```bash

```

This command will display the size of the specified file or directory in kilobytes.
